# dotfiles
These are my relevant dotfiles.

On a fresh install you can clone this directly in your
(empty) home folder.

But you can also cherry pick the files you like.

# List of software

This is the stuff I use

- gvim
- cinnamon
- ranger
- zathura
- mpv
- youtube-dl
- youtube-viewer
- urxvt
- pandoc
- texlive-most texlive-lang

Note: compiling documents with my pandoc scripts
requires a ``.csl`` file in the ``~/Documents/.common/`` 
directory.
